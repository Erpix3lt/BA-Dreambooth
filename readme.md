# Dreambooth training
Training of Dall E generated imagery, being augmented, in order to create a training dataset of 11 images. Further regularization images were created using stable diffusion. 

## Huggingface
Due to the size of each model, i uploaded them to my huggingface profile. When using them reference them as the variable written first. After trying to improve the setup and fix certain issues, I have now settled for four final models. The rest will also be listed here.

### Final Experimentation:
Image prompt: Dress made out of flowers<br>
Reference variable: flodre<br>
DOI: 10.57967/hf/0365<br>

### Final Recreation:
Image prompt: green skirt made out of wool, spikes on the belt, black and white advert<br>
Reference variable: greskr<br>
DOI: 10.57967/hf/0366<br>

### Final Alteration:
Image prompt: Traditional Oktoberfest Lederhosen made from recycled undersee internet cables<br>
Reference variable: traok<br>
